## Formatting a duration

When a command requires a `duration` parameter, you format it as a number followed by a unit. The unit can be one of the following:

- `s` for seconds.
- `m` for minutes.
- `h` for hours.
- `d` for days.
- `w` for weeks.

For example, `1d` stands for one day, and `1w` stands for one week. You can also combine them â€” `1w2d` means one week and two days.

    ```javascript Correct
    ,timeout @member 1h
    ,timeout @member 2d3h
    ```
    ```javascript Incorrect
    ,timeout @member 1 hour
    ,timeout @member 2 days 3 hours
    ```

</CodeGroup>

## Removing entries via ID

For certain commands, entries can be removed using their ID. You can find the ID by using the `list` subcommand.  
Once you have the ID, use the `remove` subcommand with the format: `select:ID`.
