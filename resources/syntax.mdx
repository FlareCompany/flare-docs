## Formatting a duration

When a command requires a `duration` parameter, you format it as a number followed by a unit. The unit can be one of the following:

`s` for seconds ; `m` for minutes ;
`h` for hours ;
`d` for days ;
`w` for weeks.

For example, `5d` stands for five days, and `1w` stands for one week. You can also combine them — `1w3d` means one week and three days.
