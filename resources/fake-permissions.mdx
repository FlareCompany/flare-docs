When you run the `fakepermissions` command, you'll be prompted to specify a permission—for example: `,fakepermissions @Moderator manage_nicknames`.

<Info>
This command only allows users to bypass permission checks within **flare** — it doesn't grant the actual permission. For example, if a moderator receives the `ban_members` permission through fake permissions, they can only ban users using the `ban` command via **flare**, not through other bots or the Discord client.
