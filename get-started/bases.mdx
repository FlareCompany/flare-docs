# Hybrid commands

Some commands of flare can be used with prefix and with slash, some aren't available in DMs.
Server related commands such as ban, fakepermissions, snipe... can't be used in DMs but general commands like weather, choose... can be used in DMs.

To be able to use flare's commands everywhere, you must add and authorize the application to your account.
