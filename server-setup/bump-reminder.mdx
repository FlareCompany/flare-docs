## Explanation

Bumping your server through **DISBOARD** will your discord server appear in [disboard.org](https://disboard.org)
You can add tags and a description to present your server to all disboard users. After bumping you need yo wait **2 hours** before doing another bump, this is why we have a reminder so it's easier for you. (also if you forgot dumi)
