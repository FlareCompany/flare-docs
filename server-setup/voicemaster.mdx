## Getting started

The first step to using **VoiceMaster** is to use the `voicemaster setup` command.

<Tip>The created channels can be **moved** and **renamed** to your liking.</Tip>

### What is the interface channel?

The `#interface` channel will contain an embed with buttons that allow members to customize their temporary voice channel. This channel should be locked to keep the embed message at the top of the channel.

### What is the Join to Create channel?

The **Join to Create** channel is where members will join to create their temporary voice channel. This channel is required for the **VoiceMaster** system to work.

## Customizing new voice channels

You can customize what the temporary voice channels look like when they're created.

More commands are planned.

    <Accordion title="Setting the default channel name">
        <Info>The name can use the `{user}`, `{user.name}` and `{user.display_name}` variables.</Info>
        <CodeGroup>
            ```javascript Syntax

            ```

### Setting up the permissions

If you're interested in making your `#interface` channel only visible to members inside a temporary voice channel, you would need to set the permissions accordingly.

You would need to deny the **View Channel** permission for the `@everyone` role and allow the **View Channel** permission for the role you set in the previous step.

## Customizing your voice channel

The following commands can be done via the `#interface` channel.

### Renaming your voice channel
