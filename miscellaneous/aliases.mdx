# Aliases types

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="General Aliases" icon="server">
        With the general aliases, you can add more ways to execute a command with a custom word, it doesn't have to fit the same name as a command or another alias, moderators can edit them in the server and people can use them if the have the right permissions for the commands.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Self Aliases" icon="user">
        Self aliases are personal aliases that you can use everywhere with flare.
        <Warning>
           Self Aliases are only available for **premium users**.
        </Warning>
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# Aliases Arguments

Aliases can also contain arguments, which means you can even add more customization and shortcuts within flare.

For example setting an afk alias called "dogwalk" and instead setting the reason to "I'm walking my dog."

<Note>
    For aliases such as this one, it is preferable to use a **selfalias** (and you don't have permissions in every server).
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
    ```javascript Syntax
    ,selfalias add (alias) (command) {arguments}
    ```
     ```javascript Example
    ,selfalias add dogwalk afk I'm walking my dog.
    ```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
    You can also use the **subcommands** to see the list of aliases/selfaliases, add and remove aliases.
